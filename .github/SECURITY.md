# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report them privately:

- Email: bruno.plays2023@gmail.com
- Or: open a GitHub issue and mark it clearly as security-related, but avoid sharing exploit details

I’ll respond as soon as possible.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest published version.
